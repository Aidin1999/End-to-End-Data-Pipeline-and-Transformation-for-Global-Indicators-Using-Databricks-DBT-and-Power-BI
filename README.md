# 🌍 Global Development Dashboard: End-to-End EDA & Visualisation Using Databricks, dbt (MSSQL), and Power BI

This project showcases an end-to-end data pipeline and visualisation process for analysing global development indicators between **2000 and 2020** using:

* 🧠 **Databricks** (for notebook-based data exploration and transformation)
* 🏗️ **dbt (MSSQL)** (for structured modelling and SQL transformation)
* 📊 **Power BI** (for dashboard design and storytelling)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Databricks

* Launch **Databricks**.
* Open and run `Global_Development.ipynb`.
* It processes the data using Spark and prepares it for further transformation.
* Ensure the raw CSVs from the `/data` folder are uploaded into your Databricks environment.

### 2. dbt (MSSQL)

* Navigate to the `dbt-mssql/global_development` directory.
* Initialise your dbt project using:

  ```bash
  dbt init global_development
  ```
* Merge the provided `models/` folder and `dbt_project.yml` file into your initialised project.
* Place `import/bar_population.csv` and use `schema.sql` to create the necessary tables in your MSSQL database.
* Run the dbt transformations:

  ```bash
  dbt run
  ```

### 3. Power BI

* Open Power BI Desktop.
* Connect to your MSSQL database where the transformed models are stored.
* Build dashboards or refer to the included `Global_Development.pdf` for design examples (note: the PDF is used because Power BI Desktop doesn't export `.pbix` natively for version control).

## 📈 What’s Visualised?

The dashboards explore:

* **Economic Indicators** (GNI, GDP, inflation, unemployment)
* **Tourism Analytics** (arrivals, departures, revenue vs. GDP)
* **Environmental Trends** (CO₂ emissions, renewable usage)
* **Social Development** (internet usage, life expectancy, human development)

Each dashboard is built using **DAX**, calculated fields, smart filters, and storytelling visuals to uncover 20 years of global development trends.
